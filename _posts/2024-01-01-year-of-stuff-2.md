Okay, so. Maybe something every day was a little aggressive. Maybe this year we'll do something more realistic. Maybe the whole concept of forcing creative output into a rigid calendar-based timeline is always doomed to fail and is the wrong way to try to motivate it. Yeah, sure, maybe. Oh well, can't think of a better way to do it so here we go again!<!--more-->

I wouldn't necessarily call the [2023 Year of Making Stuff](/year-of-stuff/) a *failure* exactly; I did make a lot of stuff, and I knew going into it that it was going to be tough to keep up with such a demanding target. And it's my own made up game on my own website with my own name on it so I get to decide the rules anyway. At the very least it was one of those valuable learning experiences I hear so much about. It certainly helped me crystallize what my actual goals with something like this are, and feeling guilty about not doing enough on time is decidedly not one of them. 

## The Good

Motivation is always a challenge for me since I have a day job that keeps me busy and, y'know, fed and housed and whatnot. Anything I do on here is by definition going to be *extra* and is never going to be a real priority. This is labor of love territory, and it's a crowded space. I like to do a lot of things: [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/pettazz) (I am today starting training for my second marathon), [reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/pettazz), [playing games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/pettazz), along with [making my own creative stuff](https://fartdepot.biz). And those are just the things that I can link to, I do other stuff too. So really this is a matter of finding time among all these things, which is exactly why this kind of artificial construct can be helpful. Without any particular motivating force behind me, I'm going to end up going for whatever gives me the most instant satisfaction. Coming up with an idea and drawing a whole comic about it is a long process that's kind of hard and probably won't come out the way I want it to, but just playing another 3 rounds of CS2 is easy! But with just the slightest nudge in the direction of doing something that math changes. So I'll keep the general concept of arbitrary calendar goals because they help motivate me.

## The Bad

I never finish anything. I mean, really. I either started or continued with how many projects last year that are still not complete. Fart Depot dot Biz seems to be the only exception, it is a [fully extant website](https://fartdepot.biz), but I had intended to do some kind of pipeline for posting images so I don't have to dick around with imagemagick every time, so even that isn't really *done*. Delphi, Slike, even Inktober, I love to get started and just quit once I'm neck deep in it. This is something I want this year's nonsense to push me towards: complete projects over quantity of *stuff*. 

## The New

This year we'll do something different. This year is going to be The Year of Twelve Projects and what good is a project if it doesn't have some kind of resolution. It's not to say that every single thing I take on *has to* be completed in exactly the way I envisioned it, only that it has to have a defined end point that is reachable within a month. For a website it might mean some kind of MVP version of it one month, and then an expanded version of it the next. For drawing it might be finishing an Inktober-like or a set of full comics. It could even mean that I quit on something if it turns out to be infeasible or just a bad idea, but it will be an intentional quitting rather than just putting it off to some exponentially increasingly far away "tomorrow".

## 2024

It's still my website and my aribtrary bullshit, so the "rules" such as they are are not exactly set in stone. It's going to be more vibes-based this year, and that's fine! I'm not sure yet whether I'll try to do another tracker situation or just do a blag post retrospective for each of these things, but either way here's hoping this time next year I'm doing a post about what a wild success this all was and how cool I feel for having done it.
