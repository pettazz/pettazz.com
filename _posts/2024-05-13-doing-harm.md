I’m not going to spend a whole blag post making fun of one dumb guy’s dumb tweet, as fun and easy as that would be (just most of it). Not only because I did not take the Hippocratic Oath, but because I have [far more productive things to do with my time](https://steamcommunity.com/id/pettazz). But I think it kind of neatly sums up the state of Tech People lately in a way that it definitely wasn’t intended to.

![A very dumb tweet in which some guy responds to a review of the Humane Pin by saying: I find it distasteful, almost unethical, to say this when you have 18 million subscribers. Hard to explain why, but with great reach comes great responsibility. Potentially killing someone else’s nascent project reeks of carelessness. First, do no harm.](/images/donoharmtwete.png)

“First, do no harm,” is such a weirdly specific quote to pull here. The only[^1] reason you would invoke the Hippocratic Oath like this is if you think what you’re doing is so important, so *vital* that it makes perfect sense to equate it with *being a doctor*. You talk like this when you think you’re doing something so inherently good for humanity that even trying and failing is altruistic. You would think that this person is talking about a machine that reverses climate change by converting carbon into cancer cures that rain from the sky. But they’re not. I don’t know how to emphasize that enough, they’re **extremely not**. They’re talking about a toy for rich people designed to make other people rich. It’s a gadget, it costs $699 (plus $24.99 per month!), and [it does not work](https://www.theverge.com/24084444/humane-ai-pin-hands-on). Even if it did work exactly as advertised, it would still just be a neat little toy that costs $699 (plus $24.99 per month!) that might serve as a first iteration of other neat little toys that eventually cost only like $299 (plus $15.99 per month!). We are not exactly saving lives here.

This isn’t new or surprising; the Tech Industry as a whole long ago perfected a closed loop between ass and lungs as it strove to better huff its own farts. The HBO series Silicon Valley was already [making fun of this a decade ago](https://youtu.be/B8C5sjjhsso). But this really inadvertently lays it bare in a kind of honest way that you don’t often get to see from these people. Whether it’s true believers in [the weird cult that’s basically just a retroactive justification for doing whatever we want](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-acronym-behind-our-wildest-ai-dreams-and-nightmares/) or a cynical framing of obscene profit as beneficence, there’s usually some more artifice around it than “criticizing my product is just like letting a patient die on the table.” 

I don’t know who he is and I definitely don’t want to find out but I feel confident in saying this dude’s not one of the [luminaries we’re always unfortunately hearing from](https://twitter.com/tsarnick/status/1789115194939265173), he’s just some guy who’s been infected by second, third, or nth order brain rot that trickled down from them. He’s not trying to sell the Humane Pin itself, but he feels invested in selling the idea of AI as vital to humanity’s future[^2]. I could credibly be accused of techno-optimism at times but I don’t think I’ve had this scale of delusion about what we’re all doing here since my brain finished forming. 

[^1]: Okay I guess not *only*, it’s also possible to just be very, very stupid.
[^2]: He does have a blue check so I assume it’s a non-zero amount of attempted financial scam, but hey pobody’s nerfect.
