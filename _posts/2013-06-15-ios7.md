# I Have Things to Say About iOS 7 

Everyone else has been talking about it, and I haven't been doing much talking at all on here lately, so why not take this opportunity to shout some more opinions into the void? I have both an iPhone 5 and an iPad Mini, but since I rely on the iPad to make my TV work, I don't plan on upgrading it to a flaky beta OS anytime soon. So this will only be about my experience using iOS 7 on my iPhone 5 for five days.

## The Icons

I'm not sure most of the people reviewing and commenting on iOS 7 are aware that there have been changes other than the icons, and even then, they've turned into such a polarizing issue. Clearly you either love them and believe they are heralding a glorious new world of design, or you hate them and think Jony Ive's real goal here is to destroy Apple from the inside out.
