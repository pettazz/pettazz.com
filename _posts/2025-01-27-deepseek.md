A Chinese company called DeepSeek has [released open source AI models](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) that use [a tiny fraction of the resources](https://venturebeat.com/ai/open-source-deepseek-r1-uses-pure-reinforcement-learning-to-match-openai-o1-at-95-less-cost/) to [match and even sometimes outperform](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00229-6) anything our local US tech overlords have produced. Not only do they run cheaper and better, they do it with a level of transparency into their reasoning that [our guys keep telling us is simply impossible](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/openai-peeks-into-the-black-box-of-neural-networks-with-new-research/). *And* they did it less than a week after [Trump announced a $500 billion handout to the AI industry](https://spectrum.ieee.org/stargate) to, I assume, really maximize the comedic timing.

> I've been posting more than a little about how useful I think "AI" is for the duration of this latest tech hype-bubble, how I am absolutely baffled by the fact that everyone seems to be playing along with the idea that a massively scaled up version of the predictive text feature of your iPhone keyboard is somehow capable of knowledge and consciousness, and how it's just being used to fuel ([sometimes literally](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-25/ai-needs-so-much-power-that-old-coal-plants-are-sticking-around)) the worst parts of the tech industry. But at least LLMs aren't totally useless aside from the grift in the way that crypto and NFTs and the legless Metaverse are, so I will admit that it's nice to see [some real progress on these things](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2025/01/open-source-deepseek-r1-runs-at-200-tokens-per-second-on-raspberry-pi.html) beyond "more effectively stuffing money into Sam Altman's pockets."

The fact that they were able to do this is about as obvious an object lesson as there could be illustrating that the entire US AI industry, such as it is, is fundamentally structured less around building something useful and more around inflating the value of compute resources themselves: NVIDIA's chips, Microsoft's Azure cloud compute, Google and Amazon and everyone else's massive datacenters. The real purpose of AI[^1] has been for showing investors somewhere they can sink massive amounts of money, whether it's into the new AI companies themselves and driving that valuation to truly absurd heights by promising the literal moon, or into companies that had been relatively stagnant in their growth now suddenly showing off an exponential growth curve as the demand for their chips and datacenters grows. Because, as we all know, a company that just makes a billion dollars every year selling people something they want and use is fucking worthless; what's really important is a company that produces a graph where a line keeps going up, steeper and steeper. 

Okay well, I suppose this is sort of a bold claim I'm making here, let's see if there's anything currently playing out to real-- oh god oh fuck

So maybe I'm not alone in thinking this way. Seems like The Free Market[^2], blessed be its name, also woke up today with two big takeaways after a long weekend pondering the DeepSeek R1 results:

1. The cost of all the American AI models and by extension the need for the massive amount of compute resources being disgorged into them is total bullshit and not based on actual, scientific reality but rather the people making money off of it wanting to make more money off of it
2. I better get the fuck outta these investments before everyone else does

I was 100% confident that this was yet another bubble that would one day burst like the rest, but I really did not expect it to happen so soon and in such a funny way. Anyway, now that the entire tech industry is suffering a systemic shock and likely downturn let me just continue to try to get a job there, ah, well, nevertheless. Shit.
