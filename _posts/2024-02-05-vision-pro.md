First off, let me explain myself. I have owned an HTC Vive VR headset since 2017 and I have been accused of being an Apple fan, two embarrassing admissions. The first is because I play a lot of video games and they made at least [one good one for the thing](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/3/23/21188169/half-life-alyx-review-rift-half-life-3-valve-index-vive-virtual-reality), and the second is because Apple makes a lot of neat toys that happen to coincide with a lot of my hobbies.<!--more--> The MacBook Pro is great for writing code on, the iPad is the only thing I'm [vaguely capable of drawing on](https://fartdepot.biz/drew/), and the Apple Watch has become something I've come to rely on entirely for running. It's not that I think I wouldn't be able to do any of these things without Tim's beautiful gifts, but they're good at either adding something valuable to each of these things or just making it easier. And of course once you already have, say an iPhone and an Apple Watch, and you need something else, like a pair of headphones, you're going to feel pretty compelled to get the ones that are made specifically to work with both of those two devices rather than another brand that makes you deal with Bluetooth pairing every five minutes. They get their foot in the door with something that genuinely improves your life, and then they use that to sell you the warm embrace of their (semi) walled garden. This has been the game for years and it's been tremendously successful. 

Now they're just doing something different instead.

The Vision Pro is an incredible machine that is meticulously designed and engineered with the kind of power and precision that has been Apple's hallmark for decades now, bringing to bear the massive weight of its completely vertically integrated processes from design to suply chain to manufacturing, all presented in the usual advertising and media campaign that relentlessly shows you that it is cool and desireable everywhere from bus wrappings to Tik Tok ads to spots the ostensible Serious News covering it as though it simply descended from the heavens fully-formed as a blessing upon us all,

*deep breath*

...all for something that most people at best don't care about but mostly actively do not want. 

As previously mentioned, I'm someone who both already has a VR headset *and* is at least a part-time resident of the Apple Inc. Gated Community for Nerds with Disposable Income. I should be the perfect target audience for this thing, but I would describe my level of interest in it as roughly the same as a dog turd standing balanced perfectly on end: I'm going to say "wow that's wild" and have a lot of questions about how it was made to be that way, but I'm also going to think a lot less of you if I see you walking around with it on your face.

I'm not one of those "we used to build things in this country" dopes for tech but think about what a different place we're in today than we were just ten years ago. The things that became "revolutionary" got that way because they were things people *actually wanted*. Everyone on the planet today owns a phone that can trace its lineage directly to the iPhone because it gave you internet access and a bunch of different devices all combined into a neat little package in your pocket. They bought it because of that, not because they wanted to be part of an [in-progress revolution](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/smart-glasses/apple-vision-pro-review). This thing is being made *at* us and not *for* us.

It probably seems like a purposely obtuse criticism to say that I don't want to have to strap an *apparatus* onto my skull to check my emails, but that's what we're being sold. VR has been consumer-grade accessible for a decade at this point, and despite some [really, really expensive efforts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/07/31/just-how-deep-is-mark-zuckerberg-s-metaverse-money-pit/3312578c-2f99-11ee-85dd-5c3c97d6acda_story.html), the best use cases for it anyone has come up with are games and porn, neither of which are going to be available in a real way on this device, as refined a version of it as it may be. I'm sure the immersive movie viewing experience is great and that it's cool to [watch forty-seven different games at once](https://twitter.com/AlexFinnX/status/1753791237318926605), but I'd rather just watch it on a big TV in a room with my friends and not have anything on my face. It doesn't do much that's new and those few things aren't worth the price of entry: climbing into The Machine That Isolates You From Everyone. Yes, I'm sure after a few iterations they'll make it lighter and less obtrusive, and that's not solving the main problem here; I don't care that it will be so much easier to completely shut myself off from the world in my NBA goon cave.

The whole thing feels like an elaborate and expensive metaphor for the state of capitalism as a whole: expending an incredible amount of resources to produce something that no one wants, while telling us it's actually charting the new course of human history. The sales pitch here is the same as the last few iterations of tech hype garbage: "Crypto/NFTs/DAOs/AI/Metaverse/Vision Pro is inevitably where we're headed, don't you want to get in on it early?" I'm not quite naive enough to believe that this is a new phenomenon, but at least you used to get *something* out of it, a car or a phone or whatever. Now you just get a few thousand dollars poorer and/or a worse way to live your life.
