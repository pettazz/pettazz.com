So I'm currently working on the [Stripe CTF: Web Edition](https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag-20). My user page links to this site, so I figured I'd post something new for the first time in roughly ever. I'm keeping track of everything, so I promise to make a full post describing the solutions once the contest closes next week. Until then, good luck, and holy shit this is fun.
