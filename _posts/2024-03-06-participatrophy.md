I am a millennial, and this is a post about millennials. I can, of course, only speak for myself, as I haven't been to any of our weekly heckin’ millennial adulting meetings lately, also I have never knowingly eaten avocado toast, so I hardly think I'd be nominated as a spokesman for us all. But I can tell this one story about myself. 

When I was younger, I played rec-league soccer. I was awful. I was never once an asset to my team except maybe on the rare occasion that I put my own *je ne sais quoi* on the art of defense: panic and try to get the ball as far away from me as humanly possible. I went to all the practices, I went to all the games, and I also didn't improve for all eight years I played. Sometimes my randomly assembled team for that year ended up winning games and becoming the league champions, and sometimes we didn't. At the end of winning seasons, a pizza party would be held and trophies would be handed out. At the end of losing seasons on the other hand, a pizza party would be held and trophies would be handed out. The difference being that in the latter scenario, the trophy would be transformed into that thing so despised by the older generations. That loathed item, laughed at through gritted, hateful teeth, always invoked with a sneer, the innate and primal bane of all Boomers both literal and spiritual: *the participation trophy*.

> I told you I was going to do more posting-ass posting here, didn’t I? It’s not all going to be about different ways to go on the computer! That's right, sometimes I'm also going to spend way too much time thinking about a completely offhanded comment I hear a stranger make!

Yet despite my proud and ever-growing shelf of Participation Trophies, I never seem to have internalized the lesson that these people complain is inevitable when engaging in this kind of moral hazard. I don’t actually think that I’m owed the title of winner simply for existing. And what’s ironically funny is that that's a painfully cynical view from someone who *did* internalize something very different from us: that winning is *exclusively* what matters. 

What those trophies meant to me every year that I was handed one with my name etched into the tiny brass plate below some strangely posed and faceless soccer player statue was in fact that I had done something worth rewarding: I had been a part of the team and worked towards our goal. What a year ending with that trophy said was that I showed up to all the games and practices. I offered my skill, little as it was. It didn't work out this time, another team did it better than we did, and they got slightly cooler looking trophies. But the fact that we lost didn't make it an inherently futile exercise. 

I don’t think I’ve ever posted about it here but if you know me or have seen my presence on pretty much any other website, you know that I’m for sure some kind of Leftist, politically. I’m not smart enough to understand all the differences between the types or sectarian nuances and more importantly I don’t want to get yelled at, so I won’t give myself any more of a particular brand name than “guy who thinks the Democrats are centrists at best.” This means that I’m joining a long tradition of losers in this country. 

> Ah fuck I’m gonna get yelled at anyway, huh? Good thing my Disqus token expired half a decade ago. Also, does Disqus even exist anymore?

Not “loser” in the sense of [unpopular or unwanted, certainly](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/08/poll-marijuana-legalization-data-for-progress-radical-ideas-popular-aoc.html), but definitely in terms of being absolutely boxed out of any semblance of effective power by the ruling class. This country (and plenty of others of course) has a long history of [making sure that even the most moderate actual-left voices get utterly marginalized at best](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-bernie-michigan-results/), often by coalescing across supposed ideological differences against them. Because when it comes to class solidarity, the capitalists seem to be pretty mad about it unless it’s among their own. 

A string of near-total victories for the opponent, stretching back for generations would probably be a good reason to give up or to not bother trying. In fact, that’s what a lot of the people who hold the power count on, that we simply won’t put the effort in because we think we can’t win. They see the world as a zero-sum game between winners and losers; “if someone else is winning then it means I must be losing.”

But us smol bean millenialerinos, we've learned something different. We know that winning isn't everything. We know that losing happens, and that just because the end is a loss, it doesn't invalidate the efforts that led to it. We know the value of persistence even in the face of failure. We know that just because a thing may not succeed, it doesn't mean that thing is not worth doing wholeheartedly. We know that winning feels pretty great, but it's not the only goal, and most importantly we know that it’s not a reason not to show up. 

At least, that’s what I’ve learned, and the idea that other people have too is what keeps me as mildly hopeful for a better future as I am. But either way, I can very proudly say that I didn't show up expecting to win; I'm here to participate.
