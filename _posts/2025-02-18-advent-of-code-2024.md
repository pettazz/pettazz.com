Finding myself with a surprising amount of free time at the end of the year let me actually participate in something I'd wanted to for the past ten years but never got around to doing: [the Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about)! I had a great time doing [CTFs and other similar things](https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag-20) in the past, but AOC always felt like a heavier lift both because it felt a little more "hardcore" let's say, and given that time is usually scarce around this season. But this year [due to reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Le4sGUeXTk) I have plenty of time and a good reason to show off how good I am at the computer.

AOC is a series of 25 holiday themed programming puzzles released every night at midnight starting the morning of December 1st, through Christmas day. The site tracks your progress as well as scores based on time from the puzzle's release til submitting a correct answer. Every player gets their own input which produces a unique (or, at least unique enough) answer, so it's either impossible or extremely unlikely that you could just paste someone else's answer into yours and get the star. Each puzzle also has two parts, each awarding one star. The first is typically a more straightforward version of the problem that should effectively be the "easy" half, and then the second is an expansion on the first, introducing some twist that increases the complexity and/or really explodes the problem input space to make brute force solutions impossible. The site's own scoring is only for the first 100 people to unlock every star; everyone from the 101st to the last who submits a correct answer doesn't earn any points from it. So unless your goal is to be ready to write some quick code at midnight every night, this leads to goals being very much self-directed.

If you look around [the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) you'll see plenty of people posting about the goals and challenges they've decided for themselves, typically things like trying to write [the shortest possible code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf), or the most performant code, or just do it all in some new language they want to learn. Feeling some combination of inspired, bored, and completely ignorant of how hard these would get, I landed on my own set of goals for this year, in this order:

1. Get all fifty stars
2. Be able to explain my solution
3. Re-write it in a bunch of languages I don't currently know:
  - Go
  - Rust
  - Swift (I know it but I don't *know* it, y'know?)
  - Racket (ok I did know this one, [once](https://course.khoury.northeastern.edu/cs2500f16/2006-exam1.pdf))
  - Haskell

> Since I'm doing the initial solving in Python, my beloved, I wanted to really mix it up here. Reasons for these choices range from "it's practical in career terms" to "it'll make me look smarter than I actually am" to even "lol, lmao"

To make life easier, I'm intentionally avoiding relying on external libraries (or even module imports) as much as possible, and preferring more explicit (sometimes more verbose) code over cleverer stuff that's harder to read and translate. Language-specific features (like Python list comprehensions) are obviously fine, but I'll try to avoid them on the Python side since I already know that one, and instead pick up any new ones from the others. I also won't be translating both parts of every day. They're usually pretty similar, part two being an expanded version of one, so it will just be whichever is more interesting.

As I'm writing this, I've finally completed the first goal [*long, exhausted exhale*]. So, welcome to goal number two.

## Day 1, Part 1

> <https://github.com/pettazz/aoc24/tree/main/1.1>
{: .notice}

We're easing in with a comparison of two sorted lists of numbers. The complication is that the input gives us the lists unsorted and one item from both lists at a time, line by line. So we just need to parse the file into two lists, sort them, then loop through again to get the absolute value differences. Honestly the trickiest part of this was figuring out how to parse files into lists in all these languages and remembering how strict typing works.

## Day 1, Part 2

> <https://github.com/pettazz/aoc24/tree/main/1.2>
{: .notice}

Our first added twist is finding how many instances of each entry in the first list appear in the second. We just need to manage two separate loops here, one for tracking the first list item, and the other for counting instances in the right list. Not tremendously difficult, but really helpful for me to get introduced to the available loops in each of the new languages, or in the case of the functional ones, remembering the mindset: maps and filters here, not loops.

> Thinking in Functional Language is giving me some intense circa 2010 sense memories. I swear to god as I am remembering how `let` bindings work I can smell my roommate cooking his nightly chicken breast doused in Adobo seasoning.

## Day 2, Part 1

> <https://github.com/pettazz/aoc24/tree/main/2.1>
{: .notice}

Day two and we're already working on a nuclear reactor, this is escalating quickly. Luckily all we're doing is reviewing series of numbers to verify that the differences within each series follow the rules: all are either increasing or decreasing, and differences are between one and three (inclusive). Perfect time for a [sliding window](https://builtin.com/data-science/sliding-window-algorithm) if ever I've seen one. For each series, we loop through while maintaining one pointer to the current reading and one to the next, checking that the difference is in our valid range and whether it's positive or negative. 

## Day 2, Part 2

> <https://github.com/pettazz/aoc24/tree/main/2.2>
{: .notice}

As we all know, nuclear fusion reactors are allowed to be a little bit unsafe, as a treat. So we now need to check whether any of the currently unsafe series would instead be okay if we removed one item. One of the constraints that makes a report safe is that the numbers are all either ascending or descending, and a key realization to make this puzzle much easier is that we can simplify our validity check to only allow for ascending, checking each report forward *or* backward. For example, if we check the report `5 4 3 2 1` forwards, it fails our ascending test, but backwards it's perfectly fine. This might not save us a lot of trouble in Part 1 but here in Part 2 it eliminates the need to keep track of ascending vs descending and whether removing an item changes that. Think about `5 6 4 3 2 1`; when we start initially it's ascending, but then we hit that `4` and it's suddenly no good and now we don't know which direction we should be going. Our check becomes `if isReportOk(report) || isReportOk(report.reversed())` and that concern is eliminated, leaving the `isReportOk` loop to simply assume numbers should be ascending and within the valid range, and allow skipping exactly one value that violates either constraint. This also comes in handy with the functional languages so we can completely isolate `isReportOk` as a recursive check through the list in only one direction.

## Day 3, Part 1

{: .notice}

> **WORK IN PROGRESS**: I've [finished all the days in Python](https://github.com/pettazz/aoc24), but I'm still working through the other languages and write-up, so I thought I'd post this as I progressed through the rest of that.
