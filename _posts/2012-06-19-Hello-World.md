Turns out Jekyll is pretty cool.

I don't know anything about Ruby or SASS or even Markdown (even though I have a repo for a PHP library to convert to and from Markdown), and it's been roughly 317 years since I actually designed anything myself, let alone built it with CSS/HTML, so I decided to make one of these as a learning/remembering experience. Yes, I did blatantly rip off (I mean fork) [tatey.com](http://tatey.com)'s design, but I had to start somewhere, and I fully intend to rewrite it all, bit by bit into something different. 

Or I'll just completely forget about this and you're looking at the only content it will ever have. Who knows?
