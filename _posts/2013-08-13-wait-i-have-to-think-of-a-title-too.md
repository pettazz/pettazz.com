title: "Wait I Have To Think of A Title Too?"

Waiting for a new post from me is like waiting for your ; I wouldn't recommend holding your breath while doing so. I've been an odd combination of busy, bored, motivated, and lazy all at once lately, and I've tried to keep writing things as much as possible, though I don't think anything to come out of me lately would fit well here. Instead of promising more frequent posts, which everyone knows I won't deliver on, I'll list a few of the topics I've been messing around with that *would* work well here, sort of as an incentive to myself to actually make them ready for public consumption and get them posted.


>####TVRobot####
He's still here and has been happily chugging away procuring more distractions for my retinas than I have hours in the day to watch. His SMS API has grown more complex, and some of his methods for cleaning up downloaded files and finding good downloads have gotten a bit more intelligent, but he's still everyone's favorite lovable robot buddy.

>####iOS 7####
I've been using it since the first day of the beta, and I have very important things to say about it. Well, maybe not important, but everyone else is talking about it, so why shouldn't I jump on the bandwagon, huh?

>####JACKED#####
Oh don't give me that look, I came up with the name when I was literally still in high school and the whole project was to make an easy admin section for my friends' webcomic sites. Since then, it's grown from a "CMS" to an actual framework including a simplistic ORM, all in PHP. These days it's less about satisfying an immediate need for a product, and more about satisfying the need to work on something new that I've never wrapped my head around before, specifically the intricacies of Oject Oriented PHP and building the ORM. Maybe it'll be useful to someone someday, and maybe in a few months I'll just start over yet again from scratch. This is *that* kind of project.

>####Selenium Stuff###
My day job as a Dev-QA sort of person has continued to provide me with infinite opportunities to impress my coworkers with the usefulness of Selenium tests, and just as many opportunities to completely fuck it up and look like an idiot. Such is life as a one-man Dev-QA team. From the wonders of reliable testing on a local instance as a gate for Continuous Integration to the thin line between providing realistic and accurate testing results to developers while not spamming them with every QA server flub, I've got plenty to write about here. Maybe my insights will get me a feature at the next Selenium Conference (which I also went to this year and should probably write about my experiences with). 

>####Life Junk####
Contrary to popular belief, I do actually have a life outside the internet. Maybe I'll tell you people about it sometime, and maybe I won't. You're not my Dad. Unless you are, in which case: hi, Dad.

>####Learning New Things####
They say that one of the best ways to reinforce your own knowledge of something is to teach someone else. And who better to teach than the **entire internet**? Maybe I'll decide to jump back into iOS dev, now 4 OS versions later, and try to make something stupid. I *have* seen an alarming drop in fart-based apps in the App Store lately. Or maybe I'll decide that I finally need to figure out wtf WSGI actually is instead of copypasta-ing various httpd.conf snippets from the internet and calling it a day. In any case, rest assured that I'll be posting my experiences here as tutorials straight from the "expert" himself. 


So there's my List of Important Topics to Change The World™. I won't insult your intelligence by offering any timeframes, but pay attention for some new stuff…eventually.
