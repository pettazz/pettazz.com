In a highly scientific study I have determined that he most common blog post in the world is the one where the author claims they're going to start posting more because they like it and they were recently reminded about how much they like it so now it's time to get back at it. These posts are very easily identified because they're often the only ones on their respective websites every few years.

Anyway, I'm going to be posting here more. 

With the ongoing slow implosion of Twitter, I've realized that most of the places I get what you might consider "news" or even just "interesting things to read" have for a long time been provided to me almost exclusively by services entirely out of my control. I shuffle up to one of the feeder hoses inserted into my enrichment enclosure and guzzle down whatever slops out of it. This is not necessarily a bad thing when these sources are working the way they were intended: when Twitter had a bunch of people posting stuff I actually wanted to see, I could follow them and curate my own feed, and places like Hacker News or Reddit at their best inherently surface good stuff to the top and bury the garbage. But of course, that is not how most of this actually works in the year of our lord 2024.

I don't have the energy or desire to rehash the bullshit that's gone on with [Twitter](https://www.theverge.com/c/23972308/twitter-x-death-tweets-history-elon-musk) and [Reddit](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/10/23756476/reddit-protest-api-changes-apollo-third-party-apps) in the last year alone (and HN is always [suspect at best](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/01/y-combinator-ceo-wishes-death-to-sf-supervisors/)), but the end result is that wonderful constellation of Quality Posters have become scattered across a bunch of different platforms (if they're even still posting at all), which makes curating my own feed much more difficult and raises some doubts about what's actually getting surfaced by the aggregators. I don't know how to find good stuff to look at anymore!

This is partly my Own Damn Fault for just allowing myself to be drip fed a bunch of corporations whose motives are, at best, making a profit off my attention. There's been a better way for two and a half decades now that I just haven't been using because it takes a minor amount of effort to set up: **RSS**. Through the magic of decentralized syndication, I can simply subscribe to any website I choose (and if they don't have a feed they weren't worth following anyway) without the need for someone else's input about whether I should read it or not. 

Because I can never make things easy on myself, I've set up [my own feed aggregator with FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org), and am trying out [Wallabag for saving individual articles](https://wallabag.org) and producing a feed of them that goes back into FreshRSS for a reading list of things I want to read but don't necessarily want to subscribe to daily updates. On top of this I'm using [NetNewsWire on iOS/iPad/Mac](https://netnewswire.com) with a custom theme to actually read the things. NNW doesn't support anything like cloud saves in itself, so having everything run via my FreshRSS server keeps it all in sync across platforms. 

> If I ever get to a point that I'm satsified and done tweaking the theme I will post it here, I promise.

All this is to say that I've been inspired to change my behavior on the other end of the content pipeline as well. Why am I putting my thoughts into Elon's dumpster when I could be putting them somewhere that I control myself? Sure, yeah, the reach is likely much greater on a network like Twitter, but if I exclude all the crypto or porn bots liking my tweets I think I'm getting about the same amount of human eyeballs either way (zero). And having it here doesn't preclude then posting those to another site anyway. If anyone is interested my content is not any less accessible, if anything it's *more* when you don't have to rely on a billionaire to show it to you.

I've always liked writing even when it doesn't have any real purpose, so I plan to do more of it. This is not an exercise in self-marketing or replicating the dopamine hits I get from likes (I can still reply to any Ted Cruz tweet with `pig poop balls dot jpg` whenever I want that), this is just making use of something [I've had set up for years](/hello-world/) and rarely got around to actually enjoying. 

And I promise this is the last time I'll do a post about why I'm posting; I'll simply be too busy posting.
