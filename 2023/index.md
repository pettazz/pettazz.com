The official Year of Making Stuff Live Trackerâ„¢ is finally here, sort of. Still in progress so expect changes, but I suppose this is the rough shape of my accountability death pact page. <a href="/year-of-stuff/">I did a <strike>better</strike> job of explaining what this is all about here</a>.

<div class="timeline">

  <h1><small>January</small></h1>
  
  <p>Why, this very page you see before you! Still needs a fair amount of help, specifically templatizing it so I don't have to do so much manual editing each day and can use markdown in these little blurbs. I'd also like to add a little graphic for "type of thing" to indicate whether it was writing or a doodle or some coding nonsense, but it's off to a good start if you ask me. Original cool timeline thing taken from <a href="https://codepen.io/letsbleachthis/pen/YJgNpv" target="_blank">this CodePen</a>; I feel like I learn ten new things about CSS every time I do anything with it these days.</p>

  <p>500 words in the creative style that I don't have a place to post just yet, so you'll just have to take my word for it until I get that figured out, so <code>//TODO</code></p>

  <p>This was some work on the project I've been calling Delphi, a Raspberry Pi desk clock display sort of thing. I had an incredibly poorly written prototype years ago and am now trying to turn it into something usable and stable. This latest commit is actually a massive one including a ton of rewriting I had already been poking at for the past few months, but importantly today's changes were starting to write the weather modules using one API and then immediately giving up on it and switching to another that works better for what I need (<a href="https://pirateweather.net" target="_blank">Pirate Weather</a>). <a href="https://github.com/pettazz/delphi/commit/8295ab14a8961591cdddccb01901d8fd45cd182a">Check it out here</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="/year-of-stuff/">The blog post about what I'm doing here</a>. I understand that you may well consider this a sort of a cop out but I think 500 words are 500 words and as that is the totally arbitrary goal number I've set for this type of thing, it counts. So I simply don't know what else to tell you.</p>
